[Scientific but Not Academical Overview of Malware Anti-Debugging, Anti-Disassembly and Anti- VM Technologies](http://research.dissect.pe/docs/blackhat2012-paper.pdf)
* This talk catalogs the common evasion techniques malware authors employ, applying over 50 different static detections, combined with a few dynamic ones for completeness. We validate our catalog by running these detections against a database of 4 million samples (the system is constantly running and the numbers will be updated for the presentation), enabling us to present an analysis on the real state of evasion techniques in use by malware today. The resulting data will help security companies and researchers around the world to focus their attention on making their tools and processes more efficient to rapidly avoid the malware authors' countermeasures.

During runtime HoneyAgent traces function calls from the analysed application. It is displayed which class calles which function with which parameters. Reflected function calls are translated to the original function names for simpler reading.

[How ESEA detects cheat software in its online gaming league - Let's get physical!](http://everdox.blogspot.com/2015/02/how-esea-detects-cheat-software-in-its.html)
* Before we dig in, this post should not be construed as an attack on ESEA, anti-cheat software, or fair gaming in general. It is simply an analysis thereof, detailing what the ESEA driver does on your machine. Although analysis will make attack vectors clear and obvious, no code or detailed explanation of how to leverage these points will be given.

[Automating Removal of JS Obfuscators](http://www.contextis.com/resources/blog/automating-removal-java-obfuscation/)
* In this post we detail a method to improve analysis of Java code for a particular obfuscator, we document the process that was followed and demonstrate the results of automating our method. Obscurity will not stop an attacker and once the method is known, methodology can be developed to automate the process.

[Paranoid Fish](https://github.com/a0rtega/pafish)
* Pafish is a demo tool that performs some anti(debugger/VM/sandbox) tricks. Most of them are often used by malware to avoid debugging and dynamic analysis. The project is open source, you can read the code of all anti-analysis checks. You can also download the compiled executable (or compile it by yourself) and reverse engineer it, which is quite recommended.

####Tools

[API Monitor](http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor)
* API Monitor is a free software that lets you monitor and control API calls made by applications and services. Its a powerful tool for seeing how applications and services work or for tracking down problems that you have in your own applications.

[SpyStudio](http://www.nektra.com/products/spystudio-api-monitor/)
* SpyStudio shows and interprets calls, displaying the results in a structured way which is easy for any IT professional to understand. SpyStudio can show registry keys and files that an application uses, COM objects and Windows the application has created, and errors and exceptions.


###Static Malware Analysis
####Tools
[Ssdeep](http://ssdeep.sourceforge.net/)
* static malware comparison tool
* ssdeep is a program for computing context triggered piecewise hashes (CTPH). Also called fuzzy hashes, CTPH can match inputs that have homologies. Such inputs have sequences of identical bytes in the same order, although bytes in between these sequences may be different in both content and length. 

[DRAKVUF](https://tklengyel.github.io/drakvuf/)
* DRAKVUF is an agentless dynamic malware analysis system built on Xen, LibVMI, Volatility and Rekall. It allows for in-depth execution tracing of malware samples and extracting deleted files from memory, all without having to install any special software within the virtual machine used for analysis.

* Pyew is a (command line) python tool to analyse malware. It does have support for hexadecimal viewing, disassembly (Intel 16, 32 and 64 bits), PE and ELF file formats (it performs code analysis and let you write scripts using an API to perform many types of analysis), follows direct call/jmp instructions in the interactive command line, displays function names and string data references; supports OLE2 format, PDF format and more. It also supports plugins to add more features to the tool.

[Microsoft Message Analyzer](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40308)
* Microsoft Message Analyzer is a new tool for capturing, displaying, and analyzing protocol messaging traffic and other system messages. Message Analyzer also enables you to import, aggregate, and analyze data from log and trace files. It is the successor to Microsoft Network Monitor 3.4 and a key component in the Protocol Engineering Framework (PEF) that was created by Microsoft for the improvement of protocol design, development, documentation, testing, and support. With Message Analyzer, you can choose to capture data live or load archived message collections from multiple data sources simultaneously.
