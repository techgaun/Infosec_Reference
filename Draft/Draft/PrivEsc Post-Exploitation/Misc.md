[Shellpaste](https://github.com/andrew-morris/shellpaste)
* Tiny snippet of code that pulls ASCII shellcode from pastebin and executes it. The purpose of this is to have a minimal amount of benign code so AV doesn't freak out, then it pulls down the evil stuff. People have been doing this kind of stuff for years so I take no credit for the concept. That being said, this code (or similar code) works surprisingly often during pentests when conventional malware fails. 

[stupid_malware](https://github.com/andrew-morris/stupid_malware)
* Python malware for pentesters that bypasses most antivirus (signature and heuristics) and IPS using sheer stupidity
