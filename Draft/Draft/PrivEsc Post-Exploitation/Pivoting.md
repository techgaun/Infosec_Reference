Local Port Forward
Situation
Bob (Attacker – IP 192.168.1.2) – Wishes to browse the super secret webpage on Suzie’s computer.
Ryan (SSH Server on Port 22 – IP 192.168.1.50 & IP 10.1.1.40) – A dual homed SSH server which Bob has stolen credentials for.
Suzie (Victim running a web service on port 80 – IP 10.1.1.90) – The target we wish to access who is running a super secret intranet page. 
Command 

ssh <ssh server> -L  <Port on Attacker's Machine>:<Victim IP>:<Victim Port We Want>

Example 

ssh ryan@192.168.1.50 -L 1234:10.1.1.90:80

Once this command is executed, and the password entered, do not interact with this shell. Alternatively you can use the -f -N flag to background the ssh port forward upon connection. In this situation Bob can now browse localhost:1234 and what he will see is actually the secret intranet page Suzie is hosting on port 80, all routed through the SSH server Ryan.

From Stack
For example, there's a server at my office I frequently need to access, which we'll call server.example.com. I can't connect to it directly, but I can ssh to myofficemachine.example.com. So I do this: 
ssh -L 3389:server.example.com:3389 myofficemachine.example.com
 
And then I point my local Remote Desktop client to localhost.
