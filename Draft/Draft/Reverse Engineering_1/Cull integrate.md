[Netzob Documentation](http://netzob.readthedocs.org/en/latest/overview/index.html)
* Originaly, the development of Netzob has been initiated to support security auditors and evaluators in their activities of modeling and simulating undocumented protocols. The tool has then been extended to allow smart fuzzing of unknown protocol.

[Somfy Smoove Origin RTS Protocol](https://pushstack.wordpress.com/somfy-rts-protocol/)
* This document describes the Somfy RTS protocol as used by the “Somfy Smoove Origin RTS”. Most information in this document is based on passive observation of the data send by the Smoove Origin RTS remote, and thus can be inaccurate or incorrect!

[ Reverse Engineering The eQSO Protocol](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7a9d713e61ba990a3a17)
* Today I reverse engineered the eQSO protocol. If you didn't know, eQSO is a small program that allows radio amateurs to talk to each other online. Sadly this program isn't as popular as it used to be (Well, neither is the radio).


[How to RE data files?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/l8ac0/how_to_re_data_files/)
* Good read over.

[PortEx](https://github.com/katjahahn/PortEx)
* PortEx is a Java library for static malware analysis of Portable Executable files. Its focus is on PE malformation robustness, and anomaly detection. PortEx is written in Java and Scala, and targeted at Java applications.

[Medusa](https://github.com/wisk/medusa)
* Medusa is a disassembler designed to be both modular and interactive. It runs on Windows and Linux, it should be the same on OSX. This project is organized as a library. To disassemble a file you have to use medusa_dummy or qMedusa. wxMedusa and pydusa are not available anymore.

[x86 opcode structure and instruction overview](http://pnx.tf/files/x86_opcode_structure_and_instruction_overview.pdf)

[Xmount](https://www.pinguin.lu/xmount)
* What is xmount? xmount allows you to convert on-the-fly between multiple input and output harddisk image types. xmount creates a virtual file system using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) that contains a virtual representation of the input image. The virtual representation can be in raw DD, DMG, VHD, VirtualBox's virtual disk file format or in VmWare's VMDK file format. Input images can be raw DD, EWF (Expert Witness Compression Format) or AFF (Advanced Forensic Format) files. In addition, xmount also supports virtual write access to the output files that is redirected to a cache file. This makes it possible to boot acquired harddisk images using QEMU, KVM, VirtualBox, VmWare or alike.

[STOKE](https://github.com/eschkufz/stoke-release)
* STOKE is a stochastic optimizer for the x86_64 instruction set. STOKE uses random search to explore the extremely high-dimensional space of all possible program transformations. Although any one random transformation is unlikely to produce a code sequence that is both correct and an improvement over the original, the repeated application of millions of transformations is sufficient to produce novel and non-obvious code sequences that have been shown to outperform the code produced by general-purpose and domain-specific compilers, and in some cases expert hand-written code.

https://code.google.com/p/alpha3/
ALPHA3 is a tool for transforming any x86 machine code into 100% alphanumeric code with similar functionality. It works by encoding the original code into alphanumeric data and combining this data with a decoder, which is a piece of x86 machine code written specifically to be 100% alphanumeric. When run, the decoder converts the data back to the original code, after which it is executed. e
