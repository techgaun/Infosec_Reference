[The Art of Unpacking - Paper](https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-07/Yason/Whitepaper/bh-usa-07-yason-WP.pdf)
* Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to present anti-reversing techniques employed by 
executable packers/protectors and also discusses techniques and publicly available tools that 
can be used to bypass or disable this protections. This information will allow researchers, 
especially, malcode analysts to identify these techniques when utilized by packed malicious 
code, and then be able decide the next move when these anti-reversing techniques impede 
successful analysis. As a secondary purpose, the information presented can also be used by 
researchers that are planning to add some level of protection in their software by slowing 
down reversers from analyzing their protected code, but of course, nothing will stop a skilled, 
informed, and determined reverser
