[Open Source Windows x86/x64 Debugger](http://x64dbg.com/)

[PortEx](https://github.com/katjahahn/PortEx)
* PortEx is a Java library for static malware analysis of Portable Executable files. Its focus is on PE malformation robustness, and anomaly detection. PortEx is written in Java and Scala, and targeted at Java applications.


[binwally](https://github.com/bmaia/binwally)
* Binary and Directory tree comparison tool using the Fuzzy Hashing concept (ssdeep)
* [Using binwally - a directory tree diff tool](http://w00tsec.blogspot.com/2013/12/binwally-directory-tree-diff-tool-using.html)
[BitBlaze](http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/)
* The BitBlaze project aims to design and develop a powerful binary analysis platform and employ the platform in order to (1) analyze and develop novel COTS protection and diagnostic mechanisms and (2) analyze, understand, and develop defenses against malicious code. The BitBlaze project also strives to open new application areas of binary analysis, which provides sound and effective solutions to applications beyond software security and malicious code defense, such as protocol reverse engineering and fingerprint generation. 

[SpyStudio](http://www.nektra.com/products/spystudio-api-monitor/)
* SpyStudio shows and interprets calls, displaying the results in a structured way which is easy for any IT professional to understand. SpyStudio can show registry keys and files that an application uses, COM objects and Windows the application has created, and errors and exceptions.

[API Monitor](http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor)
* API Monitor is a free software that lets you monitor and control API calls made by applications and services. Its a powerful tool for seeing how applications and services work or for tracking down problems that you have in your own applications.


[Equip: python bytecode instrumentation](https://github.com/neuroo/equip)
* equip is a small library that helps with Python bytecode instrumentation. Its API is designed to be small and flexible to enable a wide range of possible instrumentations. The instrumentation is designed around the injection of bytecode inside the bytecode of the program to be instrumented. However, the developer does not need to know anything about the Python bytecode since the injected code is Python source.


[Firmware Modifcation kit](https://code.google.com/p/firmware-mod-kit/)
* This kit is a collection of scripts and utilities to extract and rebuild linux based firmware images.


[Binwalk](https://github.com/devttys0/binwalk)
* Binwalk is a fast, easy to use tool for analyzing, reverse engineering, and extracting firmware images.


PEStudio
PEStudio is a unique tool that performs the static investigation of 32-bit and 64-bit executable. 



Malicious executable often attempts to hide its malicious behavior and to evade detection. In doing so, it generally presents anomalies and suspicious patterns. The goal of PEStudio is to detect these anomalies, provide indicators and score the executable being analyzed. Since the executable file being analyzed is never started, you can inspect any unknown or malicious executable with no risk.

[DotPeek](http://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/features/)
* dotPeek is a .NET decompiler that has several handy features. I haven’t used it much, and don’t do much in .NET so I can’t say if its a good one, only that I’ve had success in using it.

[Microsoft Message Analyzer])http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40308)
* Microsoft Message Analyzer is a new tool for capturing, displaying, and analyzing protocol messaging traffic and other system messages. Message Analyzer also enables you to import, aggregate, and analyze data from log and trace files. It is the successor to Microsoft Network Monitor 3.4 and a key component in the Protocol Engineering Framework (PEF) that was created by Microsoft for the improvement of protocol design, development, documentation, testing, and support. With Message Analyzer, you can choose to capture data live or load archived message collections from multiple data sources simultaneously.


[API Monitor](http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor)
* API Monitor is a free software that lets you monitor and control API calls made by applications and services. Its a powerful tool for seeing how applications and services work or for tracking down problems that you have in your own applications.
