* [Transcript](http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are/transcript)
My notes from it: Why use makeup?
     Blend into crow
     Pose as employee/vendor
     Regain access if caught
     Create distraction for teammates
Whom to disguise as?
     Technician
     Sales Executive
Goodwill
     Employee
     Interview Candidate
Easy to see goings on
     Pedestrian
     Sidewalk Sleeper
Transform into another person:
     Can take minutes/hours
     Examine each physical attribute
Some modified easier than others
     Entire appearance makes the difference. One part is off, whole cover can be blown
If using hardhat, make sure to beat the shit out of it. Add stickers. 





###Research Papers

[Construal-Level Theory of Psychological Distance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3152826/)
* Abstract: People are capable of thinking about the future, the past, remote locations, another person’s perspective, and counterfactual alternatives. Without denying the uniqueness of each process, it is proposed that they constitute different forms of traversing psychological distance. Psychological distance is egocentric: Its reference point is the self in the here and now, and the different ways in which an object might be removed from that point—in time, in space, in social distance, and in hypotheticality—constitute different distance dimensions. Transcending the self in the here and now entails mental construal, and the farther removed an object is from direct experience, the higher (more abstract) the level of construal of that object. Supporting this analysis, research shows (a) that the various distances are cognitively related to each other, (b) that they similarly influence and are influenced by level of mental construal, and (c) that they similarly affect prediction, preference, and action.
